The intrusions, which  targeted around 22 Danish energy organizations  in May 2023, occurred in two distinct waves, one which exploited a security flaw in Zyxel firewall (CVE-2023-28771) and a follow-on activity cluster that saw the attackers deploy Mirai botnet variants on infected hosts via an as-yet-unknown initial access vector. The first wave took place on May 11, while the second wave lasted from May 22 to 31, 2023.

"Nov 25, 2023"," An unspecified government entity in Afghanistan was targeted by a previously undocumented web shell called  HrServ  in what's suspected to be an advanced persistent threat (APT) attack. The web shell, a dynamic-link library (DLL) named ""hrserv.dll,"" exhibits ""sophisticated features such as custom encoding methods for client communication and in-memory execution,"" Kaspersky security researcher Mert Degirmenci  said  in an analysis published this week. The Russian cybersecurity firm said it identified variants of the malware dating all the way back to early 2021 based on the compilation timestamps of these artifacts. Web shells are typically  malicious tools  that provide remote control over a compromised server. Once uploaded, it allows threat actors to carry out a range of post-exploitation activities, including data theft, server monitoring, and lateral advancement within the network. The attack chain involves the  PAExec  remote administration tool, an alternative to  PsExec  t",Cyber Attack / Threat Intelligence,,"

"Nov 18, 2023"," Russian cyber espionage actors affiliated with the Federal Security Service (FSB) have been observed using a USB propagating worm called  LitterDrifter  in attacks targeting Ukrainian entities. Check Point, which  detailed  Gamaredon's (aka Aqua Blizzard, Iron Tilden, Primitive Bear, Shuckworm, and Winterflounder) latest tactics, branded the group as engaging in large-scale campaigns that are followed by ""data collection efforts aimed at specific targets, whose selection is likely motivated by espionage goals."" The LitterDrifter worm packs in two main features: automatically spreading the malware via connected USB drives as well as communicating with the threat actor's command-and-control (C&C) servers. It's also suspected to be an evolution of a PowerShell-based USB worm that was previously  disclosed  by Symantec in June 2023. Written in VBS, the spreader module is responsible for distributing the worm as a hidden file in a USB drive together with a deco",Cyber Attack / USB Worm,,"

"Nov 13, 2023"," The threat actors behind a new ransomware group called  Hunters International  have acquired the source code and infrastructure from the now-dismantled Hive operation to kick-start its own efforts in the threat landscape. ""It appears that the leadership of the Hive group made the strategic decision to cease their operations and transfer their remaining assets to another group, Hunters International,"" Martin Zugec, technical solutions director at Bitdefender,  said  in a report published last week. Hive, once a prolific ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation, was  taken down  as part of a coordinated law enforcement operation in January 2023. While it's common for ransomware actors to regroup, rebrand, or disband their activities following such seizures, what can also happen is that the core developers can pass on the source code and other infrastructure in their possession to another threat actor.
