The end goal of the large-scale malware distribution scheme is to facilitate the takeover of corporate Facebook accounts by targeting Vietnamese individuals who manage the Facebook profiles of prominent businesses and organizations.

Cybersecurity for Healthcare—Diagnosing the Threat Landscape and Prescribing Solutions for Recovery,"Feb 21, 2024"," On Thanksgiving Day 2023, while many Americans were celebrating, hospitals across the U.S. were doing quite the opposite. Systems were failing. Ambulances were diverted. Care was impaired. Hospitals in three states were  hit by a ransomware attack , and in that moment, the real-world repercussions came to light—it wasn't just computer networks that were brought to a halt, but actual patient care itself.  Cybercriminals are more brazen than ever, targeting smaller healthcare organizations for big payouts. Sure, it would be nice to believe thieves once lived by a code of conduct, but if one ever existed, it's been torn to shreds and tossed into the wind. Sophisticated hacker groups are now more than happy to launch cyberattacks on medical clinics, nursing homes, and other health service providers.

SaaS Compliance through the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,"Feb 20, 2024"," The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework is one of the world's most important guidelines for securing networks. It can be applied to any number of applications, including SaaS.  One of the challenges facing those tasked with securing SaaS applications is the different settings found in each application. It makes it difficult to develop a configuration policy that will apply to an HR app that manages employees, a marketing app that manages content, and an R&D app that manages software versions, all while aligning with NIST compliance standards.  However, there are several settings that can be applied to nearly every app in the SaaS stack. In this article, we'll explore some universal configurations, explain why they are important, and guide you in setting them in a way that improves your SaaS apps' security posture.  Start with Admins Role-based access control (RBAC) is a key to NIST adherence and should be applied to every SaaS a",thehackernews.com,https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0rIwl-lQkPV8X_cOhyohAfEdpQaZ_uy-Qmq9MFpMM4SdHtm3m7sza3ZUYkQtbV-SK6LHHG2s_-4sT5NjDUhQMJMzsRM1Qeya12ztXUpuXE-w6NTG-vWU1qTfkhYkvb84jm8Gw_jU35JWEQJR5JGfcsN7rjGXdTY5D13O6fT-_CObdurC-YboK7y1tX4o/s728-rw-e365/as.jpg,"

4 Ways Hackers use Social Engineering to Bypass MFA,"Feb 12, 2024"," When it comes to access security, one recommendation stands out above the rest: multi-factor authentication (MFA). With passwords alone being simple work for hackers, MFA provides an essential layer of protection against breaches. However, it's important to remember that MFA isn't foolproof. It can be bypassed, and it often is.  If a password is compromised, there are several options available to hackers looking to circumvent the added protection of MFA. We'll explore four social engineering tactics hackers successfully use to breach MFA and emphasize the importance of having a strong password as part of a layered defense.  1. Adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) attacks AITM attacks involve deceiving users into believing they're logging into a genuine network, application, or website. But really, they're giving up their information to a fraudulent lookalike. This lets hackers intercept passwords and manipulate security measures, including MFA prompts.

Why Are Compromised Identities the Nightmare to IR Speed and Efficiency?,"Feb 12, 2024"," Incident response (IR) is a race against time. You engage your internal or external team because there's enough evidence that something bad is happening, but you're still blind to the scope, the impact, and the root cause. The common set of IR tools and practices provides IR teams with the ability to discover malicious files and outbound network connections. However, the identity aspect - namely the pinpointing of compromised user accounts that were used to spread in your network - unfortunately remains unattended. This task proves to be the most time-consuming for IR teams and has become a challenging uphill battle that enables attackers to earn precious time in which they can still inflict damage.  In this article, we analyze the root cause of the identity of IR blind spots and provide sample IR scenarios in which it acts as an inhibitor to a rapid and efficient process.

To meet industry requirements, organizations must maintain a fast-paced development process while staying up-to-date with the latest security patches. However, in practice, developers often face a large amount of security work without clear prioritization - and miss a significant portion of the attack surface altogether. The primary issue arises from the detection and prioritization methods used by traditional Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools for vulnerabilities. These methods lack the organizational-specific context needed to make an informed scoring decision: the score, even if critical, might not  actually  be critical for an organization because its infrastructure works in a unique way - affecting the actual impact the vulnerability might have.  In other words, since these tools depend on a relatively naive methodol",thehackernews.com,https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHckMrgxOoVQ_Wo06FfXVMoCuexbZbY2zzlXbfPvK0fwIecRJY73odbvUjhsBtdUyZ0sTKA7Tm9bn9mRQx-3D3iApLX7hAKQOXFbMbjKPP0pdnGGuiNQTxK7fm_Jggepdt7kI7otNM68wMOPOK7wGI5cvqdYAKZYB4ldN4iMTcK83AIsE_QhCnjdPLjPA/s1200/featured_image.png,"

Unified Identity – look for the meaning behind the hype! ,"Feb 08, 2024"," If you've listened to software vendors in the identity space lately, you will have noticed that ""unified"" has quickly become the buzzword that everyone is adopting to describe their portfolio. And this is great! Unified identity has some amazing benefits!  However (there is always a however, right?) not every ""unified"" ""identity"" ""security"" ""platform"" is made equal. Some vendors call the combination of workforce IDaaS and customer IDaaS a unified identity solution, while others offer a glorified 2FA service – unified only in the mind of their marketers.  Your landscape matters!   So forget for a moment what the vendors claim, and think back to  your  organization and  your   identity security  landscape.

Hands-On Review: SASE-based XDR from Cato Networks,"Feb 05, 2024"," Companies are engaged in a seemingly endless cat-and-mouse game when it comes to cybersecurity and cyber threats. As organizations put up one defensive block after another, malicious actors kick their game up a notch to get around those blocks. Part of the challenge is to coordinate the defensive abilities of disparate security tools, even as organizations have limited resources and a dearth of skilled cybersecurity experts. XDR, or Extended Detection and Response, addresses this challenge. XDR platforms correlate indicators from across security domains to detect threats and then provide the tools to remediate incidents.  While XDR has many benefits, legacy approaches have been hampered by the lack of good-quality data. You might end up having a very good view of a threat from events generated by your EPP/EDR system but lack events about the network perspective (or vice versa).

Kasseika Ransomware Using BYOVD Trick to Disarm Security Pre-Encryption,"Jan 24, 2024"," The ransomware group known as Kasseika has become the latest to leverage the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver ( BYOVD ) attack to disarm security-related processes on compromised Windows hosts, joining the likes of other groups like Akira , AvosLocker, BlackByte, and RobbinHood .

Kasseika, first discovered by the cybersecurity firm in mid-December 2023, exhibits overlaps with the now-defunct BlackMatter , which emerged in the aftermath of DarkSide's shutdown.

The Unknown Risks of The Software Supply Chain: A Deep-Dive,"Jan 24, 2024"," In a world where more & more organizations are adopting open-source components as foundational blocks in their application's infrastructure, it's difficult to consider traditional SCAs as complete protection mechanisms against open-source threats. Using open-source libraries saves tons of coding and debugging time, and by that - shortens the time to deliver our applications. But, as codebases become increasingly composed of open-source software, it's time to respect the entire attack surface - including attacks on the supply chain itself - when choosing an  SCA platform  to depend upon. The Impact of One Dependency When a company adds an open-source library, they are probably adding not just the library they intended to, but also many other libraries as well. This is due to the way open-source libraries are built: just like every other application on the planet, they aim for a speed of delivery and development and, as such, rely on code other people built - i.e., ot",thehackernews.com,https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOIzuH1WxwXuAPjBrPiyBJQaPbdzXYL9fpqRdxDWkv2vfqlsJztBvOcn6HW_q_27fsQ9sEds13Bi2fKdh2UTq5FnW7cELxO2oh_gbaEZ0jO3Ssjo8FqNdcEWpJBKrCh0mM5ENcVcmfdFE8QAgj_d1FohQZy03VcVjGTYqQK6nTbdeesbSxNXqYfPLYnwE/s728-rw-e365/my.jpg,"

New Findings Challenge Attribution in Denmark's Energy Sector Cyberattacks,"Jan 14, 2024"," The cyber attacks targeting the energy sector in Denmark last year may not have had the involvement of the Russia-linked Sandworm hacking group,  new findings  from Forescout show. The intrusions, which  targeted around 22 Danish energy organizations  in May 2023, occurred in two distinct waves, one which exploited a security flaw in Zyxel firewall (CVE-2023-28771) and a follow-on activity cluster that saw the attackers deploy Mirai botnet variants on infected hosts via an as-yet-unknown initial access vector. The first wave took place on May 11, while the second wave lasted from May 22 to 31, 2023. In one such attack detected on May 24, it was observed that the compromised system was communicating with IP addresses (217.57.80[.]18 and 70.62.153[.]174) that were previously used as command-and-control (C2) for the now-dismantled  Cyclops Blink  botnet.

Why Public Links Expose Your SaaS Attack Surface,"Jan 09, 2024"," Collaboration is a powerful selling point for SaaS applications. Microsoft, Github, Miro, and others promote the collaborative nature of their software applications that allows users to do more. Links to files, repositories, and boards can be shared with anyone, anywhere. This encourages teamwork that helps create stronger campaigns and projects by encouraging collaboration among employees dispersed across regions and departments.  At the same time, the openness of data SaaS platforms can be problematic. A  2023 survey  by the Cloud Security Alliance and Adaptive Shield found that 58% of security incidents over the last two years involved data leakage. Clearly, sharing is good, but data sharing must be put in check. Most SaaS applications have mechanisms to control sharing. These tools are quite effective in ensuring that company resources aren't open for display on the public web.

According to Ponemon Institute 1 , ""only 59% of organizations say their cybersecurity strategy has changed over the past two years."" This stagnation in strategy adaptation can be traced back to several key issues. Talent Retention Challenges:  The cybersecurity field is rapidly advancing, requiring a skilled and knowledgeable workforce. However, organizations face a critical shortage of such talent, making it difficult to keep strategies agile and relevant. Leadership Focus : Often, the attention of leadership teams is divided across various priorities, and cybersecurity may not be at the forefront. This can result in strategies becoming outdated and less effective. Board Engagement:  Adequate board support is essential for strategy evolution. A lack of comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity issues at the board level can lead to insufficient resources and support for strategic updates.

Webinar – Leverage Zero Trust Security to Minimize Your Attack Surface,"Jan 08, 2024"," Digital expansion inevitably increases the external attack surface, making you susceptible to cyberthreats. Threat actors increasingly exploit the vulnerabilities stemming from software and infrastructure exposed to the internet; this ironically includes security tools, particularly firewalls and VPNs, which give attackers direct network access to execute their attacks. In fact,  Gartner  identified attack surface expansion as a major trend to watch. So, it is not surprising that External Attack Surface Management (EASM) is a growing priority for organizations. But traditional castle-and-moat-based security architectures are ineffective at protecting enterprises against today's sophisticated attacks, which increasingly leverage AI and as-a-service models to maximize speed and damage.

Unmasking the Dark Side of Low-Code/No-Code Applications,"Dec 18, 2023"," Low-code/no-code (LCNC) and robotic process automation (RPA) have gained immense popularity, but how secure are they? Is your security team paying enough attention in an era of rapid digital transformation, where business users are empowered to create applications swiftly using platforms like Microsoft PowerApps, UiPath, ServiceNow, Mendix, and OutSystems? The simple truth is often swept under the rug. While low-code/no-code (LCNC) apps and robotic process automations (RPA) drive efficiency and agility, their dark security side demands scrutiny. LCNC application security emerges as a relatively new frontier, and even seasoned security practitioners and security teams grapple with the dynamic nature and sheer volume of citizen-developed applications.

How to Analyze Malware’s Network Traffic in A Sandbox,"Dec 13, 2023"," Malware analysis encompasses a broad range of activities, including examining the malware's network traffic. To be effective at it, it's crucial to understand the common challenges and how to overcome them. Here are three prevalent issues you may encounter and the tools you'll need to address them. Decrypting HTTPS traffic Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), the protocol for secure online communication, has become a tool for malware to conceal their malicious activities. By cloaking data exchange between infected devices and command-and-control (C&C) servers, malware can operate undetected, exfiltrating sensitive data, installing additional payloads, and receiving instructions from the operators. Yet, with the right tool, decrypting HTTPS traffic is an easy task. For this purpose, we can use a man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxy.

Unveiling the Cyber Threats to Healthcare: Beyond the Myths,"Dec 12, 2023"," Let's begin with a thought-provoking question: among a credit card number, a social security number, and an Electronic Health Record (EHR),  which commands the highest price on a dark web forum?   Surprisingly, it's the EHR, and the difference is stark: according to a  study , EHRs can sell for up to $1,000 each, compared to a mere $5 for a credit card number and $1 for a social security number. The reason is simple: while a credit card can be canceled, your personal data can't. This significant value disparity underscores why the healthcare industry remains a prime target for cybercriminals. The sector's rich repository of sensitive data presents a lucrative opportunity for profit-driven attackers.

New Report: Unveiling the Threat of Malicious Browser Extensions,"Dec 06, 2023"," Compromising the browser is a high-return target for adversaries. Browser extensions, which are small software modules that are added to the browser and can enhance browsing experiences, have become a popular browser attack vector.

Generative AI Security: Preventing Microsoft Copilot Data Exposure,"Dec 05, 2023"," Microsoft Copilot has been called one of the most powerful productivity tools on the planet. Copilot is an AI assistant that lives inside each of your Microsoft 365 apps — Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams, Outlook, and so on. Microsoft's dream is to take the drudgery out of daily work and let humans focus on being creative problem-solvers. What makes Copilot a different beast than ChatGPT and other AI tools is that it has access to everything you've ever worked on in 365. Copilot can instantly search and compile data from across your documents, presentations, email, calendar, notes, and contacts. And therein lies the problem for information security teams. Copilot can access all the sensitive data that a user can access, which is often far too much. On average, 10% of a company's M365 data is open to all employees. Copilot can also rapidly generate  net new  sensitive data that must be protected.

The  threat actors behind the operation  – codenamed Neanderthals – are known to run the criminal enterprise as a legitimate company, spawning a hierarchical structure that encompasses different members who take on various roles. Once aspiring Neanderthals are recruited via advertisements on underground forums, they are invited to join designated Telegram channels that are used for communicating with other Neanderthals and keeping track of transaction logs. The ultimate goal of the operation is to pull off one of the three types of scams: seller, buyer, or refund. In the case of the former, Neanderthals pose as sellers and try to lure unwary Mammoths into purchasing a non-existent item.

"How Multi-Stage Phishing Attacks Exploit QRs, CAPTCHAs, and Steganography","Nov 21, 2023"," Phishing attacks are steadily becoming more sophisticated, with cybercriminals investing in new ways of deceiving victims into revealing sensitive information or installing malicious software. One of the latest trends in phishing is the use of QR codes, CAPTCHAs, and steganography. See how they are carried out and learn to detect them. Quishing Quishing, a phishing technique resulting from the combination of ""QR"" and ""phishing,"" has become a popular weapon for cybercriminals in 2023. By concealing malicious links within QR codes, attackers can evade traditional spam filters, which are primarily geared towards identifying text-based phishing attempts.

How to Automate the Hardest Parts of Employee Offboarding,"Nov 16, 2023"," According to recent research on  employee offboarding , 70% of IT professionals say they've experienced the negative effects of incomplete IT offboarding, whether in the form of a security incident tied to an account that wasn't deprovisioned, a surprise bill for resources that aren't in use anymore, or a missed handoff of a critical resource or account. This is despite an average of five hours spent per departing employee on activities like finding and deprovisioning SaaS accounts. As the SaaS footprint within most organizations continues to expand, it is becoming exponentially more difficult (and time-consuming) to ensure all access is deprovisioned or transferred when an employee leaves the organization.  How Nudge Security can help Nudge Security is a  SaaS management platform  for modern IT governance and security.

Three Ways Varonis Helps You Fight Insider Threats,"Nov 15, 2023"," What do basketball teams, government agencies, and car manufacturers have in common? Each one has been breached, having confidential, proprietary, or private information stolen and exposed by insiders. In each case, the motivations and methods varied, but the risk remained the same: insiders have access to too much data with too few controls. Insider threats  continue to prove difficult for organizations to combat because — unlike an outsider — insiders can navigate sensitive data undetected and typically without suspicion. Cybersecurity is not the first industry to tackle insider threats, however. Espionage has a long history of facing and defending against insiders by using the ""CIA Triad"" principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Varonis' modern cybersecurity answer to insider risk is the data security triad of ""sensitivity, access, and activity."" Using these three dimensions of data security, you can help reduce the risk and impact of an insider attack.

WhatsApp Introduces New Privacy Feature to Protect IP Address in Calls,"Nov 08, 2023"," Meta-owned WhatsApp is officially rolling out a  new privacy feature  in its messaging service called ""Protect IP Address in Calls"" that masks users' IP addresses to other parties by relaying the calls through its servers.

The core idea is to make it harder for bad actors in the call to infer a user's location by securely relaying the connection through WhatsApp servers. However, a tradeoff to enabling the privacy option is a slight dip in call quality.

Vulnerability Scanning: How Often Should I Scan?,"Oct 19, 2023"," The time between a vulnerability being discovered and hackers exploiting it is narrower than ever –  just 12 days . So it makes sense that organizations are starting to recognize the importance of not leaving long gaps between their scans, and the term ""continuous vulnerability scanning"" is becoming more popular. Hackers won't wait for your next scan One-off scans can be a simple 'one-and-done' scan to prove your security posture to customers, auditors or investors, but more commonly they refer to periodic scans kicked off at semi-regular intervals – the industry standard has traditionally been quarterly. These periodic scans give you a point-in-time snapshot of your vulnerability status – from SQL injections and XSS to misconfigurations and weak passwords.

New PEAPOD Cyberattack Campaign Targeting Women Political Leaders,"Oct 13, 2023"," European Union military personnel and political leaders working on gender equality initiatives have emerged as the target of a new campaign that delivers an updated version of RomCom RAT called  PEAPOD . Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro attributed the attacks to a threat actor it tracks under the name  Void Rabisu , which is also known as Storm-0978, Tropical Scorpius, and UNC2596, and is also believed to be associated with Cuba ransomware. The adversarial collective is something of an unusual group in that it conducts both financial motivated and espionage attacks, blurring the line between their modes of operation. It's also exclusively linked to the use of RomCom RAT. Attacks  involving the use of the backdoor  have singled out Ukraine and countries that support Ukraine in its war against Russia over the past year.

Take an Offensive Approach to Password Security by Continuously Monitoring for Breached Passwords,"Oct 11, 2023"," Passwords are at the core of securing access to an organization's data. However, they also come with security vulnerabilities that stem from their inconvenience. With a growing list of credentials to keep track of, the average end-user can default to shortcuts. Instead of creating a strong and unique password for each account, they resort to easy-to-remember passwords, or use the same password for every account and application.  Password reuse is both common and risky.  65% of users  admit to reusing their credentials across multiple sites. Another analysis of identity exposures among employees of Fortune 1000 companies found a  64% password reuse rate  for exposed credentials. Pair these findings with the fact that a vast majority  (80%) of all data breaches  are sourced from lost or stolen passwords, and we have a serious problem.

North Korea's Lazarus Group Launders $900 Million in Cryptocurrency,"Oct 06, 2023"," As much as $7 billion in cryptocurrency has been illicitly laundered through cross-chain crime, with the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group linked to the theft of roughly $900 million of those proceeds between July 2022 and July of this year. ""As traditional entities such as  mixers  continue to be subject to seizures and sanctions scrutiny, the crypto crime displacement to chain- or asset-hopping typologies is also on the rise,"" blockchain analytics firm Elliptic  said  in a new report published this week. Cross-chain crime refers to the conversion of crypto assets from one token or blockchain to another, often in rapid succession, in an attempt to obfuscate their origin, making it a lucrative method for money laundering for crypto thefts and an alternative to traditional approaches like mixers.

Chinese Hackers Target Semiconductor Firms in East Asia with Cobalt Strike,"Oct 06, 2023"," Threat actors have been observed targeting semiconductor companies in East Asia with lures masquerading as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) that are designed to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons. The intrusion set, per  EclecticIQ , leverages a backdoor called HyperBro, which is then used as a conduit to deploy the commercial attack simulation software and post-exploitation toolkit. An alternate attack sequence is said to have utilized a previously undocumented malware downloader to deploy Cobalt Strike, indicating that the threat actors devised multiple approaches to infiltrate targets of interest. The Dutch cybersecurity firm attributed the campaign to a China-linked threat actor owing to the use of HyperBro, which has been almost exclusively put to use by a threat actor known as  Lucky Mouse  (aka APT27, Budworm, and Emissary Panda).

How to Interpret the 2023 MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation Results,"Sep 22, 2023"," Thorough, independent tests are a vital resource as cybersecurity leaders and their teams evaluate vendors' abilities to guard against increasingly sophisticated threats to their organization. And perhaps no assessment is more widely trusted than the annual  MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK Evaluations: Enterprise .  This testing is critical for evaluating vendors because it's virtually impossible to evaluate cybersecurity vendors based on their own performance claims. Along with vendor reference checks and proof of value evaluations (POV) — a live trial — in their environment, the MITRE results add additional objective input to holistically assess cybersecurity vendors. Let's dive into the 2023 results. In this blog, we'll unpack MITRE's methodology to test security vendors against real-world threats, offer our interpretation of the results and identify top takeaways emerging from Cynet's evaluation.

The Rise of the Malicious App,"Sep 21, 2023"," Security teams are familiar with threats emanating from third-party applications that employees add to improve their productivity. These apps are inherently designed to deliver functionality to users by connecting to a ""hub"" app, such as Salesforce, Google Workspace, or Microsoft 365. Security concerns center on the permission scopes that are granted to the third party apps, and the potential for a threat actor to take over the core apps and abuse those permissions. There's no real concern that the app, on its own, will start deleting files or sharing data. As such, SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) solutions are able to identify integrated third party applications and present their permission scopes.

Do You Really Trust Your Web Application Supply Chain?,"Sep 20, 2023"," Well, you shouldn't. It may already be hiding vulnerabilities. It's the modular nature of modern web applications that has made them so effective. They can call on dozens of third-party web components, JS frameworks, and open-source tools to deliver all the different functionalities that keep their customers happy, but this chain of dependencies is also what makes them so vulnerable. Many of those components in the web application supply chain are controlled by a third party—the company that created them. This means that no matter how rigorous you were with your own static code analysis, code reviews, penetration testing, and other SSDLC processes, most of your supply chain's security is in the hands of whoever built its third-party components.

How to Prevent API Breaches: A Guide to Robust Security,"Sep 11, 2023"," With the growing reliance on web applications and digital platforms, the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) has become increasingly popular. If you aren't familiar with the term, APIs allow applications to communicate with each other and they play a vital role in modern software development. However, the rise of API use has also led to an increase in the number of API breaches. These breaches occur when unauthorized individuals or systems gain access to an API and the data it contains. And as victims can attest, breaches can have devastating consequences for both businesses and individuals. One of the primary concerns with API breaches is the exposure of sensitive data. APIs often contain or provide access to personal or financial information, and if this data falls into the wrong hands, it can be used for fraudulent activities or identity theft. API breaches can also lead to severe reputational damage for businesses.

Way Too Vulnerable: Join this Webinar to Understand and Strengthen Identity Attack Surface,"Sep 05, 2023"," In today's digital age, it's not just about being online but how securely your organization operates online. Regardless of size or industry, every organization heavily depends on digital assets. The digital realm is where business takes place, from financial transactions to confidential data storage. While organizations have quickly adopted tools like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Privileged Access Management (PAM), and service account protection, a pressing question remains: Are these measures truly sufficient? With the rise of identity threats, the real battleground has shifted. It's no longer just about firewalls or encryptions but the very identities that access these digital assets. Every day, attackers devise new strategies to compromise user identities to find that weak link to gain malicious access.

Key Cybersecurity Tools That Can Mitigate the Cost of a Breach,"Sep 05, 2023"," IBM's 2023 installment of their annual "" Cost of a Breach "" report has thrown up some interesting trends. Of course, breaches being costly is no longer news at this stage! What's interesting is the difference in how organizations respond to threats and which technologies are helping reduce the costs associated with every IT team's nightmare scenario.  The average cost of a breach rose once again to $4.45 million, increasing 15% over the last three years. Costs associated with escalation and detection have rocketed up 42% during the same period. With that in mind, I was surprised to learn that only 51% of the breached entities surveyed by IBM decided to bolster their security investments, despite the rising financial consequences of dealing with a breach.

Survey Provides Takeaways for Security Pros to Operationalize their Remediation Life Cycle,"Aug 29, 2023"," Ask any security professional and they'll tell you that remediating risks from various siloed security scanning tools requires a tedious and labor-intensive series of steps focused on deduplication, prioritization, and routing of issues to an appropriate ""fixer"" somewhere in the organization. This burden on already resource-strapped security teams is an efficiency killer.  A new study , commissioned by Seemplicity and conducted by Dark Reading, provides fresh insight into how security pros handle the challenging remediation life cycle from discovery to resolution. The research reveals the obstacles security professionals face when coordinating remediation activities. The data exposes the outcomes — in increased workload and diminished risk posture — that arise from lengthy remediation times, inefficient and uncontrolled manual processes, the lack of managerial visibility and oversight across the risk life cycle.  Remediation Process Broken Down to Steps and Time Spent on Each Step ",thehackernews.com,https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZrsiC2zWqPIrRpZVworowguEYmCKJ2fgTmfPh2lTXNBgDcfexEuq7Dak1H_BWcZ8cr_6jG31g5SHH6jFGnAjX4XUkfKTGoytJxEd_6bCQyoEyeI0OpR5K4IwGJD8caF65PJkZOPBk7J3CxnQ4KUMHUBN2e5ytpFN8x5WzBxlvfAUkCwinFrFAK_ftmKM/s728-rw-e365/Article_Header-728x380.png,"

WoofLocker Toolkit Hides Malicious Codes in Images to Run Tech Support Scams,"Aug 19, 2023"," Cybersecurity researchers have detailed an updated version of an advanced fingerprinting and redirection toolkit called  WoofLocker  that's engineered to conduct tech support scams. The sophisticated traffic redirection scheme was  first documented  by Malwarebytes in January 2020, leveraging JavaScript embedded in compromised websites to perform anti-bot and web traffic filtering checks to serve next-stage JavaScript that redirects users to a browser locker (aka browlock). This redirection mechanism, in turn, makes use of steganographic tricks to conceal the JavaScript code within a PNG image that's served only when the validation phase is successful. Should a user be detected as a bot or not interesting traffic, a decoy PNG file without the malicious code is delivered.

A Penetration Testing Buyer's Guide for IT Security Teams,"Aug 03, 2023"," The frequency and complexity of cyber threats are constantly evolving. At the same time, organizations are now collecting sensitive data that, if compromised, could result in severe financial and reputational damage.  According to Cybersecurity Ventures , the cost of cybercrime is predicted to hit $8 trillion in 2023 and will grow to $10.5 trillion by 2025. There is also increasing public and regulatory scrutiny over data protection. Compliance regulations (such as PCI DSS and ISO 27001), as well as the need for a better understanding of your cybersecurity risks, are driving the need to conduct regular penetration tests.  Pen testing helps to identify security flaws in your IT infrastructure before threat actors can detect and exploit them. This gives you visibility into the risks posed by potential attacks and enables you to take swift corrective action to address them.

What is Data Security Posture Management (DSPM)?,"Aug 01, 2023"," Data Security Posture Management is an approach to securing cloud data by ensuring that sensitive data always has the correct security posture - regardless of where it's been duplicated or moved to. So, what is DSPM? Here's a quick example: Let's say you've built an excellent  security posture  for your cloud data. For the sake of this example, your data is in production, it's protected behind a firewall, it's not publicly accessible, and your IAM controls have limited access properly. Now along comes a developer and replicates that data into a lower environment.

The 4 Keys to Building Cloud Security Programs That Can Actually Shift Left,"Jul 27, 2023"," As cloud applications are built, tested and updated, they wind their way through an ever-complex series of different tools and teams. Across hundreds or even thousands of technologies that make up the patchwork quilt of development and cloud environments, security processes are all too often applied in only the final phases of software development.  Placing security at the very end of the production pipeline puts both devs and security on the back foot. Developers want to build and ship secure apps; security teams want to support this process by strengthening application security. However, today's security processes are legacy approaches that once worked brilliantly for the tight constraints of on-prem production, but struggle in ever-shifting cloud environments. As a result, security is an afterthought, and any attempt to squeeze siloed security into agile SDLC can  swell the cost of patching by 600% . A new cloud security operating model is long overdue.

How to Manage Your Attack Surface?,"Jul 19, 2023"," Attack surfaces are growing faster than security teams can keep up. To stay ahead, you need to know what's exposed and where attackers are most likely to strike.

Node.js Users Beware: Manifest Confusion Attack Opens Door to Malware,"Jul 05, 2023"," The npm registry for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment is susceptible to what's called a  manifest confusion  attack that could potentially allow threat actors to conceal malware in project dependencies or perform arbitrary script execution during installation.

5 Things CISOs Need to Know About Securing OT Environments,"Jun 28, 2023"," For too long the cybersecurity world focused exclusively on information technology (IT), leaving operational technology (OT) to fend for itself. Traditionally, few industrial enterprises had dedicated cybersecurity leaders. Any security decisions that arose fell to the plant and factory managers, who are highly skilled technical experts in other areas but often lack cybersecurity training or knowledge. In more recent years, an uptick in cyberattacks against industrial facilities and the trend of IT/OT convergence driven by Industry 4.0 have highlighted the vacuum of ownership around OT security.  According to a new Fortinet report , most organizations are looking to Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) to solve the problem.

Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Falls Victim to JokerSpy macOS Backdoor Attack,"Jun 26, 2023"," An unknown cryptocurrency exchange located in Japan was the target of a new attack earlier this month to deploy an Apple macOS backdoor called JokerSpy. Elastic Security Labs, which is monitoring the intrusion set under the name  REF9134 ,  said  the attack led to the installation of Swiftbelt , a Swift-based enumeration tool inspired by an open-source utility called  SeatBelt . JokerSky was  first documented  by Bitdefender last week, describing it as a sophisticated toolkit designed to breach macOS machines.

Unveiling the Unseen: Identifying Data Exfiltration with Machine Learning,"Jun 22, 2023"," Why Data Exfiltration Detection is Paramount? The world is witnessing an exponential rise in ransomware and data theft employed to extort companies. At the same time, the industry faces numerous critical vulnerabilities in database software and company websites. This evolution paints a dire picture of data exposure and exfiltration that every security leader and team is grappling with. This article highlights this challenge and expounds on the benefits that Machine Learning algorithms and Network Detection & Response (NDR) approaches bring to the table. Data exfiltration often serves as the final act of a cyberattack, making it the last window of opportunity to detect the breach before the data is made public or is used for other sinister activities, such as espionage.

Webinar - Mastering API Security: Understanding Your True Attack Surface,"Jun 13, 2023"," Believe it or not, your attack surface is expanding faster than you realize. How? APIs, of course! More formally known as application programming interfaces, API calls are growing twice as fast as HTML traffic, making APIs an ideal candidate for new security solutions aimed at protecting customer data, according to Cloudflare. According to the ""Quantifying the Cost of API Insecurity"" report, US businesses incurred upwards of $23 billion in losses from API-related breaches in 2022. In fact, 76% of cybersecurity professionals admitted to experiencing an API-related security incident. This is why you can't afford to ignore your API security posture , especially when you consider that APIs don't exist in a vacuum. The infrastructure components powering those critical APIs can suffer from security misconfigurations as well, leaving you open to unexpected breaches.

How to Improve Your API Security Posture,"Jun 08, 2023"," APIs, more formally known as application programming interfaces, empower apps and microservices to communicate and share data. However, this level of connectivity doesn't come without major risks. Hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in APIs to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or even take control of the entire system. Therefore, it's essential to have a robust API security posture to protect your organization from potential threats. What is API posture management? API posture management refers to the process of monitoring and managing the security posture of your APIs. It involves identifying potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers, and taking the necessary steps to remediate them.

Dr. Active Directory vs. Mr. Exposed Attack Surface: Who'll Win This Fight? ,"May 19, 2023"," Active Directory (AD) is among the oldest pieces of software still used in the production environment and can be found in most organizations today. This is despite the fact that its historical security gaps have never been amended. For example, because of its inability to apply any security measures beyond checking for a password and username match, AD (as well the resources it manages) is dangerously exposed to the use of compromised credentials. Furthermore, this exposure is not confined to the on-prem environment. The common practice of syncing passwords between AD and the cloud identity provider means any AD breach is a potential risk to the SaaS environment as well. In this article, we'll explore AD's inherent security weaknesses and examine their scope and potential impact.

Identifying a Patch Management Solution: Overview of Key Criteria,"May 17, 2023"," Software is rarely a one-and-done proposition. In fact, any application available today will likely need to be updated – or patched – to fix bugs,  address vulnerabilities , and update key features at multiple points in the future. With the typical enterprise relying on a multitude of applications, servers, and end-point devices in their day-to-day operations, the acquisition of a robust  patch management platform  to identify, test, deploy, install, and document all appropriate patches are critical for ensuring systems remain stable and secure.  As with most tech tools, not all patch management solutions are created equal, and what's seen as robust by one organization may prove inadequate for another.

How to Set Up a Threat Hunting and Threat Intelligence Program,"May 08, 2023"," Threat hunting is an essential component of your cybersecurity strategy. Whether you're getting started or in an advanced state, this article will help you ramp up your threat intelligence program. What is Threat Hunting? The cybersecurity industry is shifting from a reactive to a proactive approach. Instead of waiting for cybersecurity alerts and then addressing them, security organizations are now deploying red teams to actively seek out breaches, threats and risks, so they can be isolated. This is also known as ""threat hunting.""  Why is Threat Hunting Required? Threat hunting complements existing prevention and detection security controls. These controls are essential for mitigating threats. However, they are optimized for low false positive alerting. Hunt solutions, on the other hand, are optimized for low false negatives.

Google Introduces Passwordless Secure Sign-In with Passkeys for Google Accounts,"May 03, 2023"," Almost five months after Google  added support  for passkeys to its Chrome browser, the tech giant has begun rolling out the  passwordless solution  across Google Accounts on all platforms. Passkeys , backed by the FIDO Alliance, are a more secure way to sign in to apps and websites without having to use a traditional password. This, in turn, can be achieved by simply unlocking their computer or mobile device with their biometrics (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition) or a local PIN. ""And, unlike passwords, passkeys are resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes,"" Google  noted . Passkeys, once created, are locally stored on the device, and are not shared with any other party.

New Decoy Dog Malware Toolkit Uncovered: Targeting Enterprise Networks,"May 01, 2023"," An analysis of over 70 billion DNS records has led to the discovery of a new sophisticated malware toolkit dubbed  Decoy Dog  targeting enterprise networks. Decoy Dog , as the name implies, is evasive and employs techniques like strategic domain aging and DNS query dribbling, wherein a series of queries are transmitted to the command-and-control (C2) domains so as to not arouse any suspicion. ""Decoy Dog is a cohesive toolkit with a number of highly unusual characteristics that make it uniquely identifiable, particularly when examining its domains on a DNS level,"" Infoblox  said  in an advisory published late last month. The cybersecurity firm, which identified the malware in early April 2023 following anomalous DNS beaconing activity, said its atypical characteristics allowed it to map additional domains that are part of the attack infrastructure.

Why Your Detection-First Security Approach Isn't Working,"Apr 28, 2023"," Stopping new and evasive threats is one of the greatest challenges in cybersecurity. This is among the biggest reasons why  attacks increased dramatically in the past year  yet again, despite the estimated $172 billion spent on global cybersecurity in 2022. Armed with cloud-based tools and backed by sophisticated affiliate networks, threat actors can develop new and evasive malware more quickly than organizations can update their protections.  Relying on malware signatures and blocklists against these rapidly changing attacks has become futile. As a result, the SOC toolkit now largely revolves around threat detection and investigation. If an attacker can bypass your initial blocks, you expect your tools to pick them up at some point in the attack chain.

What's the Difference Between CSPM & SSPM?,"Apr 17, 2023"," Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and  SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM)  are frequently confused. The similarity of the acronyms notwithstanding, both security solutions focus on securing data in the cloud. In a world where the terms cloud and SaaS are used interchangeably, this confusion is understandable. This confusion, though, is dangerous to organizations that need to secure data that exists within cloud infrastructures like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as data within SaaS applications like Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Jira, Zoom, Slack and more. Assuming that either your CSPM or SSPM will secure your company resources that live off-premises is misplaced trust in a security tool that was only designed to secure either your cloud or your SaaS stack.  It's absolutely vital for decision makers to understand the difference between CSPM and SSPM, the value derived from each solution, and that both complement each other.

Why Shadow APIs are More Dangerous than You Think,"Apr 13, 2023"," Shadow APIs are a growing risk for organizations of all sizes as they can mask malicious behavior and induce substantial data loss. For those that aren't familiar with the term, shadow APIs are a type of application programming interface (API) that isn't officially documented or supported.  Contrary to popular belief, it's unfortunately all too common to have APIs in production that no one on your operations or security teams knows about. Enterprises manage thousands of APIs, many of which are not routed through a proxy such as an API gateway or web application firewall. This means they aren't monitored, are rarely audited, and are most vulnerable.  Since they aren't visible to security teams, shadow APIs provide hackers with a defenseless path to exploit vulnerabilities. These APIs can potentially be manipulated by malicious actors to gain access to a range of sensitive information, from customer addresses to company financial records.

Are Source Code Leaks the New Threat Software vendors Should Care About?,"Apr 07, 2023"," Less than a month ago, Twitter indirectly acknowledged that some of its source code had been leaked on the code-sharing platform GitHub by sending a copyright infringement notice to take down the incriminated repository. The latter is now inaccessible, but according to the media, it was accessible to the public for several months. A user going by the name FreeSpeechEnthousiast committed thousands of documents belonging to the social media platform over several months.  While there is no concrete evidence to support this hypothesis, the timing of the leak and the ironic username used by the perpetrator suggest that the leak was a deliberate act aimed at causing harm to the company.

"""It's The Service Accounts, Stupid"": Why Do PAM Deployments Take (almost) Forever To Complete?","Apr 03, 2023"," Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions are regarded as the common practice to prevent identity threats to administrative accounts. In theory, the PAM concept makes absolute sense: place admin credentials in a vault, rotate their passwords, and closely monitor their sessions. However, the harsh reality is that the vast majority of PAM projects either become a years-long project, or even come to a halt altogether, preventing them from delivering their promised security value. In this article, we explore what makes  service accounts a key obstacle in PAM onboarding . We'll learn why vaulting and password rotation of service accounts are an almost impossible task, resulting in leaving them exposed to compromise.

"New Wi-Fi Protocol Security Flaw Affecting Linux, Android and iOS Devices","Mar 30, 2023"," A group of academics from Northeastern University and KU Leuven has disclosed a fundamental design flaw in the IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi protocol standard, impacting a wide range of devices running Linux, FreeBSD, Android, and iOS. Successful exploitation of the shortcoming could be abused to hijack TCP connections or intercept client and web traffic, researchers Domien Schepers, Aanjhan Ranganathan, and Mathy Vanhoef said in a paper published this week. The  approach  exploits  power-save mechanisms  in endpoint devices to trick access points into leaking  data frames  in plaintext, or encrypt them using  an all-zero key . ""The unprotected nature of the power-save bit in a frame's header [...] also allows an adversary to force queue frames intended for a specific client resulting in its disconnection and trivially executing a denial-of-service attack,"" the researchers noted. In other words, the goal is to leak frames from the access point destined to a victim client station",thehackernews.com,https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEirzH1Mbgznd5JkWU4XTQQiyKow69Kqjg70OlkzG37-8ygvdifznnH1uLbPnDx0WglC7Y0JNexGJVc9nh8ahiHlRh_q1RPXUmn-2UrvJMjrKV2MrQIOpdTXK2HdfF65zfCasupb7ycu7qbCvao6QhkMD4zIcUJVlEjM9mA6mziuVkLDLW4RyLoK0vE_/s728-rw-e365/mac.png,"

Cyberstorage: Leveraging the Multi-Cloud to Combat Data Exfiltration,"Mar 30, 2023"," Multi-cloud data storage, once merely a byproduct of the great cloud migration, has now become a strategy for data management. ""Multi-cloud by design,"" and its companion the supercloud, is an ecosystem in which several cloud systems work together to provide many organizational benefits, including increased scale and overall resiliency. And now, even security teams who have long been the holdout on wide-scale cloud adoption, may find a reason to rejoice. Born out of the multi-cloud approach, cyberstorage enables companies to not only enjoy the benefits that multi-cloud brings but also eliminate the risk of data exposure at the same time, marking the beginning of the multi-cloud maturity era.

Where SSO Falls Short in Protecting SaaS,"Mar 27, 2023"," Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication method that allows users to authenticate their identity for multiple applications with just one set of credentials. From a security standpoint, SSO is the gold standard. It ensures access without forcing users to remember multiple passwords and can be further secured with MFA. Furthermore, an estimated 61% of attacks stem from stolen credentials. By removing usernames and passwords, the attack surface is reduced as well. SSO helps companies meet strict compliance regulations by not only enabling businesses to secure their accounts, but by helping them demonstrate that they've taken the necessary steps to meet regulatory requirements. While SSO is an important step in securing SaaS apps and their data, having just SSOs in place to secure the SaaS stack in its entirety is not enough. SSO alone won't prevent a threat actor from accessing a SaaS app. It also won't protect SaaS apps that are onboarded without the IT team's knowledg",thehackernews.com,https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEho-xJnUKKozBWEWukiv4VljG3dRUujqSanUOEc3yWj_uyELw28wYvDy6cTt2gbg7d8mLEiCdAjYyob89FPTA6g4cdT0JKSTap0NX6bpLB1Wa2kcgFDMNBhKitcU8KIcxAD6uJERMKFKumabCjDFYIVDj2kJQLbX-AEkZUDTsLuxWzzE-IGFyHzfWce/s728-rw-e365/sso.png,"

New Cyber Platform Lab 1 Decodes Dark Web Data to Uncover Hidden Supply Chain Breaches,"Mar 20, 2023"," 2022 was the year when inflation hit world economies, except in one corner of the global marketplace – stolen data. Ransomware payments fell by over 40% in 2022 compared to 2021. More organisations chose not to pay ransom demands, according to findings by blockchain firm Chainalysis. Nonetheless, stolen data has value beyond a price tag, and in risky ways you may not expect. Evaluating stolen records is what  Lab 1, a new cyber monitoring platform , believes will make a big difference for long-term cybersecurity resilience. Think of data value this way:  Stolen credentials can become future phishing attacks Logins for adult websites are potential extortion attempts Travel and location data are a risk to VIPs and senior leadership, And so on… Hackers could retaliate for non-payment by simply posting their loot to forums where the data will be available for further enrichment and exploitation.  Shining a light on dark places Even though your company may not have suffered a di",thehackernews.com,https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgi3FacEHaDN-gGFp8qoUZZkxU61UX9LmrgXsOzZPCy8kHwGkRU1L0krs5hua_w3maOFUh9FogArgTjZrxwueM2VdqinrwLtsWAlc2wzzcMegAGvlib8KB6Gz3NQ1ucIxmnaeTMnTSvc8G-FPkW44wpsnHg51EMOrR5tCvWcREBzYzdFZoZ4pNi4zNGzA/s728-rw-e365/botnet.png,"

""The ChipMixer software blocked the blockchain trail of the funds, making it attractive for cybercriminals looking to launder illegal proceeds from criminal activities such as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, ransomware attacks, and payment card fraud,"" Europol  said  in a statement. The coordinated exercise, besides dismantling the clearnet and dark web websites associated with ChipMixer, also resulted in the seizure of $47.5 million in Bitcoin and 7 TB of data. Mixers, also called tumblers,  offer full anonymity  for a fee by commingling cryptocurrency from different users – both legitimate and criminally-derived funds – in a manner that makes it hard to trace the origins.

How to Apply NIST Principles to SaaS in 2023,"Mar 13, 2023"," The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is one of the standard-bearers in global cybersecurity. The U.S.-based institute's cybersecurity framework helps organizations of all sizes understand, manage, and reduce their cyber-risk levels and better protect their data. Its importance in the fight against cyberattacks can't be overstated. While NIST hasn't directly developed standards related to securing the SaaS ecosystem, they are instrumental in the way we approach SaaS security. NIST recently released its  Guide to a Secure Enterprise Network Landscape . In it, they discuss the transformation from on-premise networks to multiple cloud servers. Access to these servers, and the accompanying SaaS apps, is through both secure and unsecured devices and locations across disparate geography. The move to the cloud has effectively obliterated the network perimeter. As a result, companies have increased their attack surface and are experiencing an escalation of attacks that ",thehackernews.com,https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjON7kA-451rAhDtAqYILYzMCXjLh48JXHSXCfod7g1o-nQFDebfbymolHM_1pQCP-xH01octxiV3pQJhrtecZclhUjX2bqvFtBrdms9zQzH6-T3dNbmB1CTfriJ2-wHtHmx-HcPdYSq1s7iYZZhCyiiWM1IoryfRM7vFCvaW7IyhhminrWp1oD_UW8/s728-rw-e365/main.png,"

When Partial Protection is Zero Protection: The MFA Blind Spots No One Talks About,"Mar 10, 2023"," Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) has long ago become a standard security practice. With a wide consensus on its ability to fend off more than 99% percent of account takeover attacks, it's no wonder why security architects regard it as a must-have in their environments. However, what seems to be less known are the inherent coverage limitations of traditional MFA solutions. While compatible with RDP connection and local desktop logins,  they offer no protection to remote command line access tools like PsExec, Remote PowerShell and their likes. In practice, it means that workstations and servers remain as vulnerable to lateral movement, ransomware spread and other identity threats despite having a fully functioning MFA solution on. For the adversary it's just a matter of taking the command line path instead of the RDP to log in as if there was not protection installed at all.

Experts Reveal Google Cloud Platform's Blind Spot for Data Exfiltration Attacks,"Mar 06, 2023"," Malicious actors can take advantage of ""insufficient"" forensic visibility into Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to exfiltrate sensitive data, a new research has found. ""Unfortunately, GCP does not provide the level of visibility in its storage logs that is needed to allow any effective forensic investigation, making organizations blind to potential data exfiltration attacks,"" cloud incident response firm Mitiga  said  in a report.

The Secret Vulnerability Finance Execs are Missing,"Feb 23, 2023"," The (Other) Risk in Finance A few years ago, a Washington-based real estate developer received a document link from First American – a financial services company in the real estate industry – relating to a deal he was working on. Everything about the document was perfectly fine and normal. The odd part, he  told  a reporter, was that if he changed a single digit in the URL, suddenly, he could see somebody else's document. Change it again, a different document. With no technical tools or expertise, the developer could retrieve FirstAm records dating back to 2003 – 885  million  in total, many containing the kinds of sensitive data disclosed in real estate dealings, like bank details, social security numbers, and of course, names and addresses.
