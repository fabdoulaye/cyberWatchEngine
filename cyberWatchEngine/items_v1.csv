Learn How to Build an Incident Response Playbook Against Scattered Spider in Real-Time,"Feb 20, 2024"," In the tumultuous landscape of cybersecurity, the year 2023 left an indelible mark with the brazen exploits of the Scattered Spider threat group. Their attacks targeted the nerve centers of major financial and insurance institutions, culminating in what stands as one of the most impactful ransomware assaults in recent memory.  When organizations have no response plan in place for such an attack, it can become overwhelming attempting to prioritize the next steps that will have a compounding impact on the threat actor's ability to retain access to and control over a compromised network. Silverfort's threat research team interacted closely with the identity threats used by Scattered Spider. and in fact, built a response playbook in real time to respond to an active Scattered Spider attack.

Zero-Day Alert: Update Chrome Now to Fix New Actively Exploited Vulnerability,"Jan 17, 2024"," Google on Tuesday released updates to fix four security issues in its Chrome browser, including an actively exploited zero-day flaw. The issue, tracked as CVE-2024-0519 , concerns an out-of-bounds memory access in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, which can be weaponized by threat actors to trigger a crash. ""By reading out-of-bounds memory, an attacker might be able to get secret values, such as memory addresses, which can be bypass protection mechanisms such as ASLR in order to improve the reliability and likelihood of exploiting a separate weakness to achieve code execution instead of just denial of service,"" according to MITRE's Common Weakness Enumeration ( CWE ). Additional details about the nature of the attacks and the threat actors that may be exploiting it have been withheld in an attempt to prevent further exploitation. The issue was reported anonymously on January 11, 2024.

How Nation-State Actors Target Your Business: New Research Exposes Major SaaS Vulnerabilities ,"Feb 15, 2024"," With many of the highly publicized 2023 cyber attacks revolving around one or more SaaS applications, SaaS has become a cause for genuine concern in many boardroom discussions. More so than ever, considering that GenAI applications are, in fact, SaaS applications. Wing Security (Wing), a SaaS security company, conducted an analysis of 493 SaaS-using companies in Q4 of 2023.  Their study reveals  how companies use SaaS today, and the wide variety of threats that result from that usage. This unique analysis provides rare and important insights into the breadth and depth of SaaS-related risks, but also provides practical tips to mitigate them and ensure SaaS can be widely used without compromising security posture.  The TL;DR Version Of SaaS Security 2023 brought some now infamous examples of malicious players leveraging or directly targeting SaaS, including the North Korean group UNC4899, 0ktapus ransomware group, and Russian Midnight Blizzard APT, which targeted well-known organizat",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCb3lbR5kKaNE9_BRADHrZqnNzA8MYLNnIDfJ8esB94HKtdiQsqC0exNVk5hWYeLbeUYgQyjqJoIshnKImmBKXjjSU_QWjoQnFtll_ge1xVfpf-nAl_f15ERLDetjxzj__ejnde7ebtIh3E27BN3Xm5UTrexnvX5p7oL_dT8oq25Pl5jwRT1UqeQb4VO8/s728-rw-e365/wing.jpg,,https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/how-nation-state-actors-target-your.html,SaaS Security,Risk Management,How Nation-State Actors Target Your Business: New Research Exposes Major SaaS Vulnerabilities 
New Findings Challenge Attribution in Denmark's Energy Sector Cyberattacks,"Jan 14, 2024"," The cyber attacks targeting the energy sector in Denmark last year may not have had the involvement of the Russia-linked Sandworm hacking group,  new findings  from Forescout show. The intrusions, which  targeted around 22 Danish energy organizations  in May 2023, occurred in two distinct waves, one which exploited a security flaw in Zyxel firewall (CVE-2023-28771) and a follow-on activity cluster that saw the attackers deploy Mirai botnet variants on infected hosts via an as-yet-unknown initial access vector. The first wave took place on May 11, while the second wave lasted from May 22 to 31, 2023. In one such attack detected on May 24, it was observed that the compromised system was communicating with IP addresses (217.57.80[.]18 and 70.62.153[.]174) that were previously used as command-and-control (C2) for the now-dismantled  Cyclops Blink  botnet.

CISA Urges Manufacturers Eliminate Default Passwords to Thwart Cyber Threats,"Dec 18, 2023"," The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is  urging  manufacturers to get rid of default passwords on internet-exposed systems altogether, citing severe risks that could be exploited by malicious actors to gain initial access to, and move laterally within, organizations. In an alert published last week, the agency called out Iranian threat actors affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for exploiting operational technology devices with default passwords to gain access to critical infrastructure systems in the U.S. Default passwords  refer to factory default software configurations for embedded systems, devices, and appliances that are typically publicly documented and identical among all systems within a vendor's product line.

Non-Human Access is the Path of Least Resistance: A 2023 Recap,"Dec 12, 2023"," 2023 has seen its fair share of cyber attacks, however there's one attack vector that proves to be more prominent than others - non-human access. With  11 high-profile attacks in 13 months  and an ever-growing ungoverned attack surface, non-human identities are the new perimeter, and 2023 is only the beginning.  Why non-human access is a cybercriminal's paradise  People always look for the easiest way to get what they want, and this goes for cybercrime as well. Threat actors look for the path of least resistance, and it seems that in 2023 this path was non-user access credentials (API keys, tokens, service accounts and secrets).  "" 50% of the active access tokens connecting Salesforce and third-party apps are unused.
